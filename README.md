## üöÄ How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your computer
- MongoDB installed locally or MongoDB Atlas account
- Git installed on your computer

### Step 1: Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhaveshburad729/Ayush-Portal.git
cd Ayush-Portal
```

### Step 2: Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file in the backend folder and add:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY= "Your Open API Key"
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=Your JWT secret key
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
```

### Step 3: setup Server
```bash
cd Server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder and add:
```
MONGODB_URI="Your MongoDB cluster URL"
```
In config at dbconnect.js set 
```
connectionString = "Your mongoDB Cluster"
```
```
npm start
```

### Step 4: Setup Frontend
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

```
Create a `.env` file in the client folder and add:
```
PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000

```
```
npm start

### Common Issues and Solutions:
